=======================
NCAS 2D Sonic to NetCDF 
=======================

Code for processing the raw Gill 2D sonic data. Assumes a particular format 
particular to the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory sonic installation, but
should be generalisable relatively straightforwardly.

Docs can be generated with Sphinx. Install it following http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html. You will need ``sphinx-autodoc``, which you might need to install with ``pip``. 

You can then generate the docs by (for HTML):

``cd docs && make html``

or (for a PDF - you will need a working LaTeX installation):

``cd docs && make latex``
